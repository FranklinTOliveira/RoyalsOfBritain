        As warlordism fragmented the Roman Empire, the Roman splinter states on Great Britain were left exposed, as they
        turned to mercenaries to provide strength to their armies. The set of treacherous mercenaries that would take
        over would be called the Anglo-Saxons after the Angles and the Saxons that were the predominant tribal elements
        among them.

        As it turned out, England, the (new) Land of the Angles, would be united by the Kings of Wessex, the West Saxon
        Land. This House of Wessex would form the royal family of England until its last king died childless. The
        succession crisis would bring the Kingdom of England under the House of Normandy.
